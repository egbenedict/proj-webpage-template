        * NOTE: For this project, you will choose TWO out of the four given parts to complete. One of those parts must be Part 1 or Part 2. In other words, you can choose any combination of two parts except the pair (Part 3, Part 4).

        <h3 align="middle">Overview</h3>
        <p>
            In this extension to Project 3-1, I chose to implement parts 1 and 4: Mirror and Glass Materials, and Depth of Field. 
            For the former part, I implemented code to both reflect and refract light, and then used Schlick's approximation to decide
            how light passing through glass would behave. For the latter part, I just needed to make slight modifications to my
            ray generating algorithm, mainly adding a step where I sample from the thin lens and calculate rays going from the image to the focal plane via
            the lens.
        </p>


        <h3 align="middle">Part 1. Mirror and Glass Materials</h3>

        <p>
            In this part, I first implemented the <code>BSDF::reflect()</code> function, which simply reflects a vector about a surface normal.
            Then I added support for mirror material by implementing <code>MirrorBSDF::sample_f()</code>. Next, I wrote code
            to refract light with a given index of refraction. Lastly, I 
            added support for glass material by implementing <code>GlassBSDF::sample_f()</code>, which involved computing and using
            Schlick's approximation.
        </p>

            Point out the new multibounce effects that appear in each image. 
        </b></p>
        <p>
            With a max depth of 0, we only see the light source. With a max depth of 1, we see the walls and floor illuminated,
            as well as a reflection of the light source in the spheres. With a max depth of 2, we now see the reflections
            in the mirror sphere, as well as softer shadows. With a max depth of 3, we see the refracted light coming through
            the glass sphere, as well as softer shadows and an illuminated ceiling in the mirror sphere's surface.
            With a max depth of 4, we see the glass ball illuminated in the mirror sphere's surface, as well as a glint of light
            on the right wall coming through the glass sphere. With a max depth of 5, we see shadows further softened. 
            With a max depth of 100, we see even further softened shadows, as well as generally a more brightly-lit scene.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><b>
            Explain how these bounce numbers relate to the particular effects that appear. Make sure to include all screenshots.
        </b></p>
        <p>
            With max depth 0, we only see light coming directly from a light source, hence only the actual light itself. With 
            max depth 1, we can now see light that bounces once off of a surface, hence all the areas that are directly illuminated
            by the light source. With max depth 2, we can see light that has bounced twice, which is why we can now see
            the reflections on the mirror sphere, as well as the softer shadows. With max depth 3, we see the refracted light through the
            glass sphere because it has bounced 3 times: off the walls/other surfaces, off the glass sphere upon entry, and off the glass sphere
            upon exit. We also see the ceiling in the mirror's reflection because that is light that has bounced 3 times: off the walls/other surfaces,
            off the ceiling, and off the mirror sphere. With max depth 4, The glass ball is illmuinated in the mirror's surface because we have one more bounce
            of the depth 3 rays from before that illuminated the glass sphere. We also see the glint of light on the right wall caused by light coming
            through the glass ball and bouncing off the wall. With max depth 5 and 100, we see softer shadows simply because we are accumulating 
            more rays of light through weird bouncing paths, and this makes the scene brighter overall.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 4. Depth of Field</h3>

        <p>
            In this part, I implemented <code>Camera::generate_ray_for_thin_lens()</code>. This function 
            generates a ray from the current pixel to the focal plane, and then uniformly samples the thin 
            lens to create a vector from the lens to the intersection point on the focal plane (that is then normalized
            and converted to world coordinates).
        </p>

        <p><b>
            In a few sentences, explain the differences between a pinhole camera model and a thin-lens camera model. 
        </b></p>
        <p>
            In a pinhole camera model, all light rays pass through a single point and thus everything is in focus because
            there is a 1-1 mapping between the image and focal planes. On the other hand, with a thin-lens camera model,
            multiple rays of light from the image plane can reach the same point on the focal plane by passing through
            different points on the lens and refracting. In this model, objects are only in focus if they are at 
            the correct focal distance from the lens; otherwise they are blurry.
        </p>

            The following 4 images show CBdragon.dae rendered at different focal distances. For all images, I used a lens radius of 0.23.
